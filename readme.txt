How to run:

1. Open the terminal
2. Navigate to the project file in the terminal
3. Run the command "npx expo start"
4. If you have Expo Go installed as an app already on your android device you can skip this step. Else, when the expo server has started connect the phone by USB (make sure usb debugging is enabled from developer options in the android phone) and expo go should be installing on your device, if not press "R" to reload the server and start the installation
5. If the server is on developmental mode, press "S" to switch to expo go mode. Else, scan the QR code using the expo go app camera. This should take you to a website. Click the second option "Expo Go" and this will take you to the expo app and open the project on the app.


The .expo file might/might not be a make file but I added it to make sure.
